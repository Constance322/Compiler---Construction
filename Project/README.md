Project idea:
The project represents a scripting language compiler for file manipulation. 
The compiler includes a lexer, parser, intermediate code generator, and a simple runtime. 
It parses a sample script with read and write operations, generates intermediate code, and simulates execution.
Users compile the code using GCC, and the resulting executable processes a file manipulationÂ script.

Logic:
A script is read from a file ("myscript.txt"), tokenized, parsed into an AST, and then the intermediate code is generated and executed.
The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the input script. 
It recognizes various token types, such as identifiers, strings, parentheses, commas, and newline characters.
It will skip whitespace characters and handle string literals enclosed in double quotes.
It also recognizes comments starting with a '#' symbol, skipping them along with the rest of the line.

The parser constructs an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the lexer.
It defines a simple script structure where each script is a sequence of statements. 
The supported statements include "read" and "write," each taking a specified number of arguments.


Afterwards, intermediate code from the parsed AST is created. For each recognized statement, it prints corresponding C code that simulates the behavior of the script. 
The example code generates file I/O operations for reading and writing files.
